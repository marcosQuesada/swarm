# K8 Swarm Operator

Defines a Swarm as a set of Peers, where peer is a member of the set.

## Autogenerated API

The update-codegen script will automatically generate the following:
```
pkg/apis/swarm/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go
pkg/generated/
```

Current limitation on auto-generation from outside GOPATH (pending to solve)
Generate as:
```
./hack/update-codegen.sh
```
